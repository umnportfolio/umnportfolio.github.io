abstract = "This document was written to describe the advance of technology and its implications on social privacy, through the lens of law. I wrote this paper for WRIT 4431, which is a class that studies how science, technology, and law have evolved with technology and now impact life today. This paper demonstrates several things about me, most notably my awareness of how technology functions within our society.I also demonstrate my insight into how technology is seamlessly integrated into society and the general lack of perception among individuals in such societies regarding the effects of technology. I also discuss how powerful information can be for making decisions and performing analysis. This paper was written to include citation from a book on privacy and technology written by an authority on the subject, Daniel Solove. This paper indicates my perception of society, which will allow readers to understand my personality and approach to technology-centric problems."
