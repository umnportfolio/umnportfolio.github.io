abstract = "This work is a testament to my awareness of how cyber attacks target the user and frequently incorporate visual strategies to entice the user into carrying out their wishes. This work also indicates my proficiency in working with high-level documents and extracting relevant information from them. Additionally, this work indicates my ability to write for my own audience, including professional tone and stylistic considerations. I wrote this document integrating six scholarly sources that discuss visual rhetoric and malware, and I have concluded that malware is significantly more effective when it employs visual rhetorical devices."
