# Biography

I am currently pursuing the CISSP and OSCP credentials in cybersecurity and I will be graduating from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelors of Science Spring 2017.

I am passionate about cyber security and its intersection with technical communication. I specifically focus on "Red Team" penetration testing and I have a vested interest in organizational security and risk mitigation.


	Ethical hacking has been a passion of mine for 

	several years and I have concentrations 

	in social engineering and modern "Red Team"
 	
	penetration testing techniques.

Technical communication has many applications within cybersecurity, and throughout my professional publications I have explored areas where technical communication principles offer insight on solving security problems.

These areas include:

	*// Malware Design and Deployment *//

	"Social Engineering"

	(Semantic Cyber Attacks)

	:: Human Computer Interaction ::

	'\ Security Usability Design \'
	
Please reach out to me if you are interested in any of my work. LinkedIn is my preferred medium.
