### Welcome
Thanks for stopping by this post. 

I plan on using this utility to issue updates on my site that don't merit the addition of a new project or publication.

Additionally, I will be using posts to notify readers when publications will be uploaded and/or establish a timeline for new content.

### Collaboration Opportunities
I am currently focusing my time on the Syncurator Project, which you can read about under my "projects" section at the bottom of the main page.

**I am looking for talent to join the Syncurator Project**

If you have skills in the following areas AND are fine with working for free - please contact me through social networks or through email.
